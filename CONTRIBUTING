Thanks for your interest in contributing ðŸ’œ

As of now most of the logic is centralized in the `src/lib/logic/values.ts` file.

So respect that schema for now.

However in the future we might move to a more modular approach.

---

## Factors

- When you add a new conversion, you need to add it to the factors in said file.
- Please for any unit added cite the source of the conversion.

## Data

- When you add a new hormone, you need to add it to the `DATA` object.
- Please for any hormone added cite the source of the data.
- If you want to add a new gender, you need to add it to the `Gender` Enum I think there are enough ones tho ðŸ˜…

## Presets

- We might add a preset system in the future, so please respect that.
- For now our target are the normal ranges for adults, both cis and trans.
